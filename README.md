# db_deployer

Deploy database objects (schemas, tables, functions, views, indexes, roles, privileges) to PostgreSQL from a directory of SQL files. Tracks changes between deployments via a local cache so unchanged objects are skipped.

Packaged as a self-contained `.pyz` executable via [shiv](https://github.com/linkedin/shiv) — drop it on `$PATH` and it runs without a venv or a system-wide install.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL client library (`libpq`) available at build time
- Target PostgreSQL server (any recent version)

On macOS with Homebrew:

```
brew install libpq openssl@3
```

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt install libpq-dev
```

## Build and install

```
make               # builds ./db_deployer.pyz
sudo make install  # copies to /usr/local/bin/db_deployer
```

Override the install prefix if you prefer somewhere else:

```
make install PREFIX=~/.local
```

Use a specific Python interpreter:

```
make PYTHON=python3.12
```

## Configuration

`db_deployer` reads all configuration from environment variables and `~/.pgpass`. No config file.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DB_DEPLOYER_REPO` | Path to the SQL repo containing `database/<name>/...` (required, or use `--repo`) |
| `PGHOST` | PostgreSQL host (standard libpq env) |
| `PGPORT` | PostgreSQL port (default 5432) |
| `PGUSER` | Connecting user |
| `PGDATABASE` | Optional; if unset, iterate all directories under `<repo>/database/` |

The same `PG*` vars are read by `psql` and every other libpq-based tool, so you can share them across your workflow.

### Passwords via `~/.pgpass`

Passwords are never accepted on the command line or in environment variables. libpq consults `~/.pgpass` automatically. Format:

```
hostname:port:database:username:password
```

Example:

```
globe.local:5432:rock_dev:roy:xxxxxxxx
globe.local:5432:rock_dev:analytics_owner:yyyyyyyy
globe.local:5432:rock_dev:reports_owner:zzzzzzzz
```

The file must be mode 0600 or libpq will refuse to read it:

```
chmod 600 ~/.pgpass
```

Multiple entries let you switch identities for privilege application without embedding secrets in the tool.

### Encryption primitive

SQL files can use `___ENCRYPT_FIELD___(<column>,<SECTION>,<KEY>)` to expand into a `pgp_sym_encrypt(...)` expression at deploy time. The secret is read from an environment variable named `<SECTION>_<KEY>` (uppercased):

```sql
SELECT ___ENCRYPT_FIELD___(password_col,ENCRYPTION,MASTER_KEY) FROM users;
```

Expects `$ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY` in the environment.

## Repository layout

The SQL repo must follow this structure:

```
<DB_DEPLOYER_REPO>/
└── database/
    ├── rock_dev/                     ← directory name = postgres database name
    │   ├── schema/
    │   │   └── analytics.sql
    │   ├── table/
    │   │   ├── users.sql
    │   │   └── orders.sql
    │   ├── function/
    │   ├── view/
    │   ├── index/
    │   ├── role/
    │   └── privilege/
    └── another_db/
        └── ...
```

Supported object types: `schema`, `table`, `function`, `view`, `data`, `index`, `role`, `privilege`.

### Ordering within an object type

Within a single object type, db_deployer processes files alphabetically by default. Two optional per-directory files let you override or supplement that:

**`manifest.txt`** — pin an explicit order for named files.

Place a `manifest.txt` alongside SQL files in any object-type directory. List filenames one per line, in the order they should be processed. Files listed in the manifest are processed first in the given order; files not listed follow in alphabetical order.

```
# database/rock_dev/table/manifest.txt
users.sql
sessions.sql
orders.sql
```

**`dependency.txt`** — declare parent/child relationships and let db_deployer topologically sort.

Format is one dependency per line, `<child>:<parent>`. A file listed as `child` will not be processed until every `parent` it depends on has been processed. Multiple parents per child are declared on separate lines:

```
# database/offsite/table/dependency.txt
core.file.sql:core.peer.sql
core.remote_peer.sql:core.peer.sql
core.remote_file.sql:core.file.sql
core.remote_file.sql:core.remote_peer.sql
```

Dependencies are resolved before deploy. If a parent file has changed and is redeployed, all its transitive children are also marked as changed and redeployed, even if their own contents are unchanged — this keeps foreign keys and view definitions consistent when their referents change.

Use `manifest.txt` for stable, explicit ordering (e.g. schemas that must exist before tables). Use `dependency.txt` for expressing real referential relationships that should trigger cascaded redeploys.

## Usage

```
export DB_DEPLOYER_REPO=/path/to/sql/repo
export PGHOST=globe.local
export PGUSER=roy
# ~/.pgpass provides passwords

db_deployer --db rock_dev --run              # deploy changed files to rock_dev
db_deployer --run                            # deploy to every db found under database/
db_deployer --db rock_dev --dev --run        # only files that have changed since last cache commit
db_deployer --db rock_dev --rebuild_cache    # mark everything as up-to-date without deploying
db_deployer --db rock_dev --verbose --run    # show SQL output during deployment
```

Without `--run`, the tool exits without doing anything — a safety measure to prevent accidental deploys.

### Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--repo PATH` | Override `$DB_DEPLOYER_REPO` |
| `--db LIST` | Comma-separated list of database names to process |
| `--run` | Actually execute the deployment (required — otherwise dry) |
| `--dev` | Only deploy files that have changed since the last cache commit |
| `--rebuild_cache` | Mark all files as up-to-date without deploying anything |
| `--verbose` | Show SQL output during deployment |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help |

## Development

Editable install into the build venv, so source edits are picked up without rebuilding the pyz:

```
make dev
source .venv/bin/activate
db_deployer --help
```

Or invoke without activating the venv:

```
.venv/bin/db_deployer --help
.venv/bin/python -m db_deployer --help
```

To rebuild and reinstall after changes are ready to ship:

```
deactivate
make clean
make
sudo make install
```

## Makefile targets

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make` / `make build` | Build `db_deployer.pyz` |
| `make install` | Build and copy to `$PREFIX/bin/db_deployer` |
| `make uninstall` | Remove the installed binary |
| `make dev` | Editable install for live-edit development |
| `make check-deps` | Verify psycopg2 can be installed on this platform |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts (keeps the build venv) |
| `make distclean` | Also remove the build venv |

## Cross-platform builds

The resulting `.pyz` bundles a compiled psycopg2 linked against the local libpq. It runs on any machine with a compatible Python interpreter and libpq at the same path.

For a fleet with mixed macOS and Linux, build once per platform on a representative machine.
